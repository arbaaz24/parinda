I am not sure what the platform is trying to achieve, lets look at it this way: i watch a video on Youtube, it is about a ride in Switzerland, i want to the same ride and possibly wait along the same places...



now i want a map that has the directions(possibly the same route), stops made by the rider (motel/hotel, cafe, restautrant, bar, diner, ferry, flight etc)



* so I am selling routes created by your fav, motovloggers.
* time and month is imp, it could be a favorable duration and original duration
* there can be snowmobiles (outdoor boys), water boats, train rides, trucks ?
* 
* i want motocloggers to come to my app to record their rides and then upload it to the app.
* #### 
* if the motovlogger has a store, then we can advertise for that and charge them a small share of the revenue
* 
* we can also contribute to the open source maps when routes are turned in
* i like restaurants too, maybe a partnership with them, the remote the restaurant the better
* it can can also be a platform to match riders that have chosen same journey > can there be a way they could see each other's location, i was thinking a slight heat map to show other riders, but will it distract the riders? A/B test



#### the challenges:

if i can create a file that google maps, apple maps can read and create the appropriate stops ?

\- KML/KMZ → Standard formats for geographic data. You can create these using tools like Google Earth, My Maps, or GIS software.

\- GPX → Common for GPS devices and apps. You can convert GPX to KML if needed.

🚦 Limitations

\- You can’t directly upload files into the Google Maps mobile app. You need to use Google My Maps (desktop) and then view them in the app.

\- Complex GPX tracks may need conversion to KML for smooth import.







will the user have to create these stops manually?

what is included in the bundle that i sell ?



#### Advantages of using opensource maps

google likes collecting your data, with open source osmand maps, that will never happen
